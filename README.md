# ESP32_Modus_Module
ESP32 modbus module intended for use with Home Assistant to support various modbus enabled devices. Currently I have used and tested:
- Nilan Ventilation with CTS602/602Light and CTS400 w. modbus
- Wavin AHC9000 floor heating
- Wavin Sentio floor heating
- EM340 electricity meter w. modbus
- NIBE F1255 heatpump (https://github.com/elupus/esphome-nibe)

There are a couple of additional code examples that has been tested and verified by users om the example code folder.

The module is not limited to those applications, but since I haven't tried other applications I give no promises !

You can buy the module here: https://ustepper.com/shop/home/18-esphome-modbus-module.html

## Disclaimer
Do this at your own risk ! You are interfacing with hardware that you can potentially damage if you do not connect things as required !
Using the hardware and code presented here is done at you own risk. The hardware and software has been tested on the devices listed above without issues.

## Updated Hardware as of February 2023
The module includes:
- ESP32-C3-MINI-1 WiFi module w. 4MB flash and 400KB SRAM
- RS485 modbus interface IC
- USB-C interface for power and programming
- Switch mode buck for powering the device from any source providing 8-24VDC (USB power not required)
- 2 x optocoupler outputs
- I/O's on two pin rows
- RJ45 interface compliant with the Wavin Sentio/AHC9000 interface

The form factor and visuals is the same as for the previous ESP32-PICO. The change results in a BOM reduction and thus a price reduction due to the integrated USB controller in the C3.

The following schematic shows the details of the module:

## Hardware pre-february 2023
The module includes:
- ESP32-PICO-MINI-02-N8R2 WiFi module w. 8MB flash and 2MB ram
- RS485 modbus interface IC
- USB-C interface for power and programming
- Switch mode buck for powering the device from any source providing 8-24VDC (USB power not required)
- 2 x optocoupler outputs
- I/O's on two pin rows
- RJ45 interface compliant with the Wavin Sentio/AHC9000 interface

#### !! THE RJ45 INTERFACE MATCHES WAVIN ONLY ! - SEE THE WIRING INFO BELOW FOR E.G. NILAN CONNECTION

On Wavin you simply use a patch cable (straight) and connect it from the module to the Modbus port and then you are done :)

The general layout for Nilan is shown in the table here (for a RJ45B !):

A wiring example on a Comfort 300 CTS602 light is shown here:

#### If in doubt, look up your Nilan diagram on www.nilan.dk or write me !

But in general you will need +8-24VDC, GND, A (modbus+) and B (modbus-) connected to run the module.

## Software + Video Guides !
The module is intended for use with Home Assistant and ESPHome though not limited to this.
See the video guide here on how to set it up wirelessly:
